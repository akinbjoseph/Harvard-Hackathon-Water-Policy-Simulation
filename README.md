## Water Beyond Borders: Reforming Water Sharing Institutions for Equitable Irrigation Access

This repository contains a policy simulation developed for addressing water management challenges in India, with a specific focus on the Kaveri Basin as a model for water governance reform.

### Project Overview

India's state-led water management system creates severe inequities between head-end and tail-end farmers, with irrigation efficiency at just 38%. Decisions made in distant capitals often ignore local realities, leading to systemic water access disparities. This project proposes three interconnected solutions to address these challenges:

1. **Stakeholder-Led Water Sharing Institutions**
2. **IoT-Enabled Monitoring Systems**
3. **Dynamic Water Rights Auctions**

### Key Challenges Addressed

- Political interference in water allocation decisions
- Lack of unified legislative framework to manage water bodies
- Water management based on state boundaries rather than basin boundaries
- Severe inequities between head-end and tail-end farmers
- Limited stakeholder participation in decision-making processes

### Technical Implementation

The repository contains an interactive digital engagement tool to help stakeholders understand the proposed reforms:

- Interactive policy reform game that introduces the key reforms
- Scenario-based learning using real examples from the Kaveri Basin
- Educational components for diverse stakeholders from farmers to officials
